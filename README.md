# Tuff Ores

## *This Mod Does not currently distribute ores itself*
## *An external ore distribution mod is needed (i.e. [Large Ore Deposits](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/large-ore-deposits))*


### Description
This mod adds "Tuff Ore Variants" of vanilla ores. The tuff ores are extremely hard to mine but drop a lot of raw ore when mined successfully. It is not reccommended to hand mine these ores as the intention is to create large ore deposits that a quarrying machine can be set up on that will return long term ore profits.

### Examples
Some Example Large Ore Deposit Configs can be found in this repository in the [large_deposits_example](./large_deposits_example/)
